The staff was very courteous and made us feel at home. The food was delicious and the hotel also arranged a cab for us at a good price for sightseeing. Overall, it was a great stay and I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable and enjoyable stay.Clean hotel with clean rooms. Restaurant with decent food and room service. Everything was perfectly maintained. The only problem I found was that there was a moldy smell in the room that they tried to cover with a air freshener. They need to air out the room and the mattress and clean the drapes to make the room smell fresh.Very proactive management who work tirelessly to elevate the experience. Also, it is one of few pet friendly places in Andhra Pradesh. Management also ensured we got a cab which agreed to take us and our dog to Araku day trip. That was really wow. Very enjoyable stay. Loved the breakfast spread as well.I suggest this property for both business stay and family stay. Excellent hospitality and food quality and taste. Executive director was always on the floor and reachable at all times.... Had a really happy stay at the property Quite reachable to cityWe visited Vizag for the long weekende of Independence day and chose Hotel winsar for our two nights stay in Vizag. We were a group of 10 people and three toddlers. the whole experience was smooth rather very very pleasant. The location is near RK beach as perfect as it can be. First comes booking process, which was very smooth and they assured we won't face any trouble while travelling with little toddlers. As promised, the service was beyond satisfactory. They were literally 'one call away'. The bathroom and rooms were always neat and clean. Food was sumptuous. The breakfast buffet was my personal favourite, the live dhosa and omelette counter was super hit. They helped us in booking cars and planning our further trips too. The behaviour of all the staffs were really‚Ä¶Recently did a road trip from Bhubaneswar to Vizag (around 1000 km both ways) with family. Trip was excellent. Booked a room for 3 nights at Winsar park. This was the 2nd time we were staying there after 7 years. It is still one of the best hotels in Vizag with a reasonable budget. At 7000 per night, they alloted the king suite ... excellent rooms with sumptuous breakfast. We even ordered ala cart for lunch and dinner . very reasonable and tasty. The management is very helpful and will go out of their way to make you feel at home.The hotel is run very professionally. . The morning breakfast buffet that they serve is just amazing. Online booking, pickup, drop facility, guided tours all available, centrally located, near the beach and very near to the centre of the city. Overall a very good experience for me and my family.It was a reunion of course mates. The focus was on the function. The peripherals would not have mattered, but for the exemplary service provided by the Manager and staff who made our trip such a great event. Probably, out of my five days of stay, there was not a single day I could resist myself from thanking the Manager and appreciating the staff for all they did for us. A. The check in was done without a hastle. The owner father son duo has such a great chemistry, wish Ambanis would have learnt a lesson.üôÇ B. The sumptuous and very refreshing breakfast was greeted by the smiles of two professional waitress. That itself is sufficient for the day. C. The rooms were maintained and cleaned on a daily basis. The housekeeping is superb. D. Our trip was made special more so because‚Ä¶Conveniently located within 1 km distance from the beach. Rooms are standard and cleaned in afternoon. Complementary breakfast is quite sumptuous. We took the cab from the hotel and he was quite kind enough to show us the city and Araku valley for our 3 day stay.A few minutes away from the RK Beach, we will remember this hotel for their amazing hospitality, politeness and service. Whether it was about enquiring about every member of the group, to catering to every request, to customising the food on the menu to our taste, they went beyond their duty. We were a big group and all of us loved our stay with Winsar Park. Would recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to Vizag. The highlight of our stay was the food, and the behaviour of the staff in the hotel. We overate, and hated leaving when the trip was over!",0.3,Restaurant,2
