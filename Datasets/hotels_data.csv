It‚Äôs a good place to stay in Hyderabad !Everything‚Äôs so perfect ü´∞far beyond all the expectations we had before actually coming here,all the staffs were so kind and have always ready to assist nature in them,we really appreciate the good deeds you all did to us in our 14 days of stay in the hotel.

The facilities were impressive and relaxing. The food was also very good with authentic taste for all dishes. The reception desk was understanding and prompt. Mr.Sumon at the concierge desk was very polite and helpful too.Very nice hotel , The best thing is that the staff of @The Park Hyderabad are very helpful. Non-veg and veg are available everywhere but we also got the facility of complete pure veg( without onion and garlic) as well in this hotel. Especially thnx to @Jagannath Sethi, he is a very decent and caring guy; he took care of us very well. Overally my experience was incredible!!!Terrible hospitality and check in process is too slow . requested for an early check in and still waiting at the lobby I find taj much better hospitality wise and the way they treat their customers . Lady in the reception kept arguing about how they can‚Äôt accommodate the guests before 2 pm .The hotel was good but the rooms were not in good shape, hotel staff was not active at all. Only breakfast was good. Not recommend unless you cannot find some other good hotel. It is not worth staying here for 10k rather go and stay in Taj.Had a great experience. Stayed here for 15 days. The room service and cleaning is top notch. Special thanks to Haseena and Harish. -Sejal (7026) Complimentary breakfast is good too. Recommended for family and friends.The room was spacious and luxurious, and I had a hard time leaving the breakfast buffet :) I especially appreciated the staff, who were kind and accommodating. Sumon kindly kept my bags safe while I waited to check in and helped coordinate my taxi to the airport. I'd happily stay here again :)The Good: 1. Our concierge, Sumon, was fantastic. He helped us on numerous occasions and we received 5 star service. 2. The Spa was wonderful. The massage was easy to schedule and the experience was great. 3. Front Desk was very helpful/quick and there was plenty of staff to assist all of the guests in a timely manner. 4. The room was spacious and had a beautiful bathroom and overall layout. The Bad: 1. Common areas including the lobby and hallways were under constant construction but somehow still looked dingy and ill maintained. It seemed a little run down and not 5-star level grand. 2. The restaurant was‚Ä¶ 3 star. Service was slow and there was no direction regarding what guests should be doing (self-seating or waiting for a host). 3. I hate writing this because the‚Ä¶Its been pleasant stay at this property. I requested for a comfort stay and they upgraded for better experience. Breakfast is also good. Mattresses were comfortable. Only thing I didn‚Äôt like is the railwaytrack outside hotel.",0.58,1

Finally had to go down to complain.They are clearly understaffed as they had just two people, out of which one had no clue about anything, so many guests waiting to check in.I was told by the guy at the front desk to complain about them being understaff. It's not my job the management should see this.I waited in the room till housekeeping was cleaning.After a long tiring day this is what the guest is expected to go through then there is no point staying there.

On the downside there are repainted and old walls in certain parts of room.My overall experience was good at the hotel but at the time of check out at night one of the hotel staff namely Sandeep misbehaved with me.

I booked this hotel because it‚Äôs only 5 mins walking to PV testing center. I gave my flight details and he arranged a chaffeur for me. The chaffeur name was Azar, he did a perfect service for me as well. He even showed me my testing center which I did not ask and dropped me to the best biryani resto in Hyderabad. How generous he is! Everything went smoothly during my stayed. The hotel‚Ä¶Hotel staffs were so warm and friendly. Thanks to Mr. Sudarshan for accomodating me and my needs were attended right away. Somehow disappointed with the tv channels since i cannot understand locals language but thanks to their fast internet connection enough to keep me entertained.Dated. Welcoming staff but hotel itself needs to be updated. The carpets in the hallways and the old smells in the rooms are proof that this hotel needs a major renovation. Good location and overall adequate but nowhere near 5 star level.Our stay at Vivanta Hyderabad was very nice and pleasant. It was our first call at Hydrabad, and we thank all staff at Vivanta for guiding us and making our vacation very memorable. The room was spacious and clean . Breakfast was very good. We that Front office Mr Sudarshan for arranging out transportation on short notice.It was a great stay at this hotel for 6 nights. We were tea Travelling with our 20 month old toddler who enjoyed a lot in this hotel, We were upgraded to their suites which was amazing .. there were small glitches which we had but can be ignored. In room dining staff (like Sayani, Zaki etc) were very good and Chef Akshay delivered customised food for my baby - Thanks for that! Front office manager, Preeti was extremely nice and helpful throughout our stay .. She even gave a farewell gift to my baby (stuff toy, earrings and chocolate!) We will love to be back to this hotel again!This outstanding hotel in Hyderabad really amazes me of how they value their guest. From Front Desk (specially to Mr. Sudarshan), porter, kitchen staff and house keeping they make sure that your comfort will be their highest priority . All of them are very polite and accommodating. I really had a great time spending my 1st stay in India beacuse of the pleasant, warm and comfort Vivanta had showed me. The food they serve specially the breakfast buffet was really one of a kind. Im looking forward to be back here in Vivanta Hotel with my family so they can also experience staying in this astonishing Hotel.Totally upto the expectations from Taj standard. Extremely customer centric staff and best hygiene standards. Food quality and in room dining was an excellent experience. From Entry to Exit, everything well organized.it was an awesome stay, we enjoy our short stay. Definitely a good choice. I recommended Bro Sudarshan, and Sri Hari for the great hospitality and all the staff. The food was great, and the room is always clean.",0.56,0

Staff is very helpful, and they in most the cases respond as soon as the query is made. Rooms also were full of space and they had good furnishings which gave it a royal look. That is the reason, You will not be able to judge that it is NOT a 5 * hotel, It definitely deserves the tag though!It's one of the best in its segment Very comfortable stay we had at Marigold Hyderabad Excellent rooms Good staff Great treatment Very helpful GM Overall Marigold ensures that it's guests are treated to utmost satisfaction Would love to stay at Marigold again soonVery Nice arrangements and so courtesy by the service staff with the leadership of Mr Ganesh and Team ,Altaf ,Sriram.

Close to USA consulate so used it. Old hotel, just next to the old airport but after the airport shifted this has become a run down hotel. Good food spread though, Right opp to the metro station.I dont know where to start... Anyway it was a terrible stay. The reasons are listed below. 1: The room was of a descent size but was dirty, the wooden furniture looked uncared for, the plywood was rickety and had layers of dust on it. The curtains, fabric used on tje bed head rest and even the linen was dirty. The curtains were dusty. 2: The AC was dirty, no ceiling fan and I had a very bad allergic reaction due to the AC dust. 3: The shower was brike, toilet seat was broken. No toiletries or towels. I had to wait for a very long time to have it arranged. 4: The corridor carpets were dirty and dusty as well. The edges of the walls and carpet had dust and that was loose. So when I walked , dust flew. 5: The single star is for the location of the hotel and their chef. ‚Ä¶Worest Room I ever seen in my entire life . Very bad experience. Never recommend to any one . Room is very bad ,to many bags & cockroaches over there . They charge 7000 rs for junior suit but its like a Room like some small chol like in dharavi Bombay . Seriously plz don‚Äôt go there .The hotel is SCAM all together. I booked a suite room for 1 night stay. It is not even worth a penny. The hotel is not clean at all, the beds are itchy bedsheets are not clean with stains. The furniture is not even usable all the white furnishing on sofas turned black with stains and mud. The bathrooms are horrible to even use. THE SMELL IS HORRIBLE ACROSS THE ROOMS AND HOTEL. I checked into the hotel on Dec29 at around 4:30 with my parents. I did not like the room I requested room change but it is same as previous room. I also requested room Freshener‚Äôs due to the HORRIBLE SMELL but no one helped me out. I checked out immediately AFTER 1 hour due to above reasons. I wanted my parents to have a great experience but it is a horrible experience for them and me. I was requested‚Ä¶This hotel has got to be one of the worst ‚Äú4 star hotels‚Äù in the city, country and maybe the world‚Ä¶. Ceiling falling apart, dirty, leaks in the bathroom, cockroaches and that‚Äôs just the start. Hotel is 20 years overdue for remodeling or at least refurbishment. I booked a suite for 4 days and wanted to leave after 5 mins in the room. I can only image how people who got regular rooms felt after booking a ‚Äú4 star‚Äù hotel from Christmas past.The Manohar is probably a 3 star hotel, located in the premises of old airport in Begumpet, Hyderabad. It was mostly 5 star in its days when started about 30 years ago. We can call it a best value as you don't get rooms at the price offered by hotel (‚Çπ2000 - ‚Çπ5000) anywhere in Hyderabad for such externally beautiful property. If you are lucky, you will get every worth of Paisa that you have spent here, otherwise it's bad experience. Don't book The Manohar if you want exemplary service. There is a swimming pool for both kids and adults.This is very unprofessional and dirty hotel. It‚Äôs sheets and used and so very dirty and smelly I asked to change and they didn‚Äôt even change. Very dirty place as they are not having cleaning stuff, nothing gets clean no toothpasteBad and smelly rooms‚Ä¶ zero service‚Ä¶Breakfast was also not good‚Ä¶ nothing like a 5 star hotel that they hv mentioned.. the rooms were dirty and had not been cleaned also, the sofas were sagging‚Ä¶ there was dust everywhere‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt fall for the 5 star tag‚Ä¶Hi i checked in this hotel on 26th early morning at 4 am where as there was no body to check me in everyone was sleeping. I waited so long and tried to wake them up but nobody would get up. The phone was ringing but no answer. After entering the room there was strong and bad smoking smell there were stains all over the sofa and the bed. The receptionist was super rude and did not feel safe at all. It is the most pathetic hotel i have visited with zero hygiene standards. Please help me with the same Email-Sahilvermaa45@gmail.comShould have got negative Stars. The Manohar Hyderabad is the WORST experience I have had so far. We checked into the hotel at 8:30 PM and got a room infested with COCKROACHES. The bedsheets and curtains were STINKING beyond tolerance. We complained and checked out within 1 hour and by 9:30 PM were outside with our luggage. The Hotel staff was cordial and they confirmed that the booking would be cancelled with full refund. But after several follow ups and calls now no one at the hotel is responding. My travel agent is also relentlessly following up with the hotel with no response. BEWARE of this hotel and STAY AWAY. They lack the basic courtesy to give a refund even after it was promised in person at the hotel. Hotel Management - if you see this I would request you to reply to‚Ä¶",0.14,0

The bathrooms were so poor and looked unfinished. The food and staff were good. The bedrooms had a very bad sewer smell which apparently came from the lake in the back. The hotel starts renovation and may be fine by the end of the year.Very quiet relaxed and comfortable. The food is excellent and the hospitality as per the best standards set by Taj. Worth a stay and the Kebab e Bahar restaurants serves some of the most tasty dishes. The location of the hotel also helps travel in all directions.Like a number of previous reviews, the issues with this hotel are around the smell coming from the lake and the tired state of the hotel. Whilst we were there the lake was being dredged so hopefully that is the start clean up process but the smell can be quite overpowering at times. I first visited this hotel in 2001, not as a guest but to eat at the restaurant and the decor does not seem to have changed since then. I know that some rooms are being refurbished and this cannot come soon enough, the outside grounds could do with updating and repair also. Having said all this I am sad to give this hotel an average rating as the staff are excellent,they are all extremely friendly, cannot be more helpful and the hotel could not be cleaner. In conclusion I would stay again as the‚Ä¶I came with my family for a relatives function and the hospitality extended to us was excellent by the staff of Taj Banjara. I‚Äôm happy to give a 5 star rating. Mr.Animesh, Mr.Yerrayya and Mr.Pravin (reception) and all staffs were courteous. I will come back to Hyderabad will have no hesitation to stay again. Next I forgot to take my bag of cash from the room and when I informed to reception they informed the security and made sure my bag of cash was safe. So rest assured things are safe. The only thing that can be improved are the rooms they need to be better ventilated and there should not be any sort of stuffiness smell. When i checked in at night our room was stuffy but then the next day when i mentioned to keep the windows open and have some room fresheners. They did it so‚Ä¶Amazing stay. Thanks to all the staff from reception to house keeping to restaurant. Special kudos to Mr Pintu & his team at restaurant for the great work they do day in and day out in making all the guests so comfortable. I am not sure about the restaurant name but is it where the breakfast & buffet dinner is served near lobbyReal value for money. Breakfast was really good, with a very selection. Staff is extremely courteous. Good property, but it's a bit dated. Heard it's going to be renovated soon. View from the room was not good, as the lake which is outside the property is not well maintained. Maybe after the renovation Taj can invest in maintaining that lake thru it's CSR program.Everything was generally great. The bathroom equipment needs better maintenance, or upgrade. The main issue is the challenge to walk the grounds or use the swimming pool due to a very bad stink from the pond alongside!We were welcomed by the stench of the so called lake ( which we were aware of but did not expect it to be so bad ) The rooms were extremely tired and the bathroom fittings needs immediate change. The beds are extremely small and the mattresses needs to be discarded. I‚Äôm X Taj and I love the Taj, but it‚Äôs so sad to see the property in the state it is. Yet the Taj has its own personality and the Taj hospitality remains the same 10/10. The lobby is warm comfortable and cozy. The BF was excellent. 8.5/10 The service at the restaurant was 10/10 However the buffet dinner could have been a bit better. Does not meet Taj standards. the so called lake is actually a hazardous septic tank which takes away the glory of the property. I do hope things work better soon to turn the‚Ä¶Wonderful experience and great hospitality by all the staff .. Mr.Majid taken well care through out ..

The hotel is located pretty much on the main road of Banzara Hills and you can enter the hotel through a nice private causeway, and there is another entry from the inside. There is a lake adjacent to the hotel and many room face the same. However, in the month of June the lake was dry. Still, the rooms are far from the main road so the views were nice. We took a higher level room hence the view was even better. The rooms are old but the amenities are new. So you will not feel outdated with the items. We faced a problem of flush not working a few times. The highlight of the stay was the elaborate breakfast. The set items had a large selection. But the live counters were also very good.

Hotel denied early check-in and demanded additional amount of Rs 1600. Room appears quite old and not well maintained. No secured wifi access. No one responded to our call. Only one lift was working, resulting in lot of wait time. No hand shower in toilet. TV did not switch on and had loose connection. Very limited channels (No sports channel). By default, no towel & other accessories in bath room. We had to call room service for each and every thing. Poor lighting. Overall, least VALUE for the money paid. Not a good experience.I have visited this hotel 4 times in every of 3 months All services and staff and rooms are West of money, Every 2 months they changing the rules Waiting from 3 hours for drinking water. No body is giving and 2 complimentary botters and other are chargeable. No lights in rooms only lamp. Air conditioner is also not working properly every time. Right I have call the staff for plates they Sayed it's chargeable 210 ruppes. I think need some treat. Hope trip advisor will do somethingReached at hotel at midnight, early than we supposed to do. We had our reservations on next day. At 3:00 O'clock at night on 10 Dec 2022 , they didn‚Äôt show us any sympathy nor any support. They didn‚Äôt allow us to sit at lobby. Moreover they pushed us to move away to other hotels. As we were foreigners, so it was very embarrassing for us to move anywhere at 3 0'clock in an unknown city. We hope no foreigner should have such a horrible experience. What a Hyderabadi reception.I stayed at Katriya Hotel due to my business trip. My booking was taken by Mr Shomit. I wanted to have good rooms and it was given 7th floor as commited during booking. Initially the telephone was not working but IT person immediately rectified it. Mr Murli was very help at reception counter. Food was tasty at restaurant. I suggest, breakfast menu should be more. The day of checkout few customers were shouting at lobby as they did not get hot water and same was in my room. I suggest management should look into the maintainance part of the hotel. I will surely visit once again.One of my worst experience, everything is bad in this hotel. From the room condition to good quality to room service, everything is worst in this hotel. Can you imagine a hotel who doesn‚Äôt have matchbox ?I have booked a hotel through Agoda.com after reviewing from the site of the hotel Katriya room pictures and details in Hyderabad city for 24th June to 26th June. Total 5 rooms booked for 3 nights. The moment when we entered the room, we have realized that we got cheated. The filthy room and corridor, poor bathroom with ugly toilets, there is no basic items like bucket and Mug, tea bags, sugar, kettles, etc.. The issue was the toilet, one of the worst toilet ever seen in my life is in Hotel Katriya Hyderabad. We have went back to reception and asked them to change the room and they refused. I have asked for the refund so that we can find any good hotel but the answer was to contact the booking site customer care since it was booked online,which is not in India and we couldn't‚Ä¶We came as a family for a day's stay in this hotel. We were given room no 407 first. The room was in a poor condition with nothing working. Geyser, the water boiler, the exhaust in the washroom all were in non working condition. Inspite of repeated requests no one turned up to help us out with it. Finally after complaining to the manager they changed our room to 421. But the sad part was this room was no better than the previous one. With even the intercom phone in non working condition. Very poor response from the staff. They are very casual and absolutely not bothered about guiding us with the things. Breakfast buffet was fine with not too exorbitant prices. Would tell my friends and relatives to never book this hotel. No value for money.Extremely happy with my stay, Well maintained hotel, clean room, perfect location,All the staff i spoke with were helpful Housekeeping staff is very Professional,Dharini and Jugender is very helpful & Room cleaning is up to the mark. Looking forward to my next visit.im dead serious . i have stayed in this hotel for six days and those days at the hotel was horrible , the key cards would not work , the room ac would not work and the service was terrible . please choose any place other than here . the food there was somewhat ok but there was not much to order from . and the bathroom is terrible , this is a 100 percent valid review. strongly disagree with their policy.Booking itself is a crap. I booked 2 rooms and they allowed only 2 adults. It doesn‚Äôt make any sense, by default it should take 4 people when I booked 2 rooms. I had to pay 2k extra for the other 2 people. Develop your website before getting into the business. And it‚Äôs non refundable too.",0.2,0

The place certainly looks quite old & needs a makeover soon. Spa & bar services have been discontinued. Attitude of the staff in the restaurant could be better. However, the room was quite comfortable & overall service standards were acceptable. The travel desk was also good.Its great to have friendly staff who are hospitable and ready to help you with the smallest of things, but the rooms need some work done on them. After all, that is the place you spend the most in a hotel. I booked a deluxe room, none of which had a king size bed. Its 2 single beds, which could be combined together on request. But the mattress is in such a way that a big gap is left in between which makes it difficult for couples to sleep in. We requested the manager for an upgrade and we were ready to pay the difference, but unfortunately there were no rooms available. This has been a pretty bad experience for us. Even the rooms smelled of dampness that come from those old buildings. Even the AC doesn't have a controller. Its just Switch on and off.

Its not a hotel in any sense but may be a glorifed choultry. Courtesy, service and cleanliness are unknown at this place. The bed was made once during our four day stay and room cleaning was suspect. There was a double bed with a mattress and thin worn out pillows. No other furniture except a couple of plastic chairs. Room service was pathetic. Prices were very high and not worth a fraction of the value. Wifii was provided. Every time we went out for our meetings or work, the only question we had to answer the young receptionist is ""are you checking out"", inspite of our paying the entire bill in advance to confirm the room‚Ä¶Good staff. Centrally located. Safe for families. Housekeeping managed by women. It should make single women guests safe. Below average breakfast. No tea/coffee kit. Breakfast only after 8.30 AM. They claim 7.30AM. Okay hotel. Their banquet business is good.This is one of the best places for lodging in Kakinada and booking this room online is cheaper than offline.Facilities are good and there are function halls inside if anything has to be planned and food is decentRecently I visit Venky residency with my friends to take a dinner there ,we enjoyed the meal it's very tasty ,we are impressed with the service of their staff .as the price is concerned it was economy .",0.34,0

Coincidentally, I had to stay back in Kaninada to meet up with my extended family. The hotel was good enough to not only extend my stay but also to cancel another hotel which was more expensive than I have booked for myself for my extended stay. All the necessary amenities such as bedding, Coffee counter, workspace (though a little cramped), bathrooms, etc...were well managed with no malfunctioning. The front desk was also helpful in arranging appropriate transport, the morning breakfast is also worth a mention with a fairly wide verity of choices.. All in all, it was a decent stay. with no complaintsI spent three days at this property situated in central kakinada, Rate was ok and worth the price, but I felt the executive rooms are little small, we took royal executive room so it was ok for family with kids, Check in was smooth though room were not ready when we reached, we waited for sometime for our respective rooms, 24 hrs check in check out available which is rare and highly convenient, Overall it was a worth stay and service was also good, Looking forward to stay again in our next visit !!!Our family was on weekend trip to Kakinada. We booked 2 standard rooms, we were alloted the same on the third floor. View from the room was fine. But the rooms are too cramped. Rooms are not child friendly. Ofcourse check in and check out were seemless. Food at Flavours of Andhra was fine and reasonable. All in all it was just OK stay at SVN Grand.I have stayed here for a night. The location of the hotel is in the heart of the city. I had a mixed experience during my stay. Let me highlight them. The biggest challenge is entering the hotel. The reception is in the mezzanine floor and you have to climb the stairs on your own with your luggage. At the reception I was told that we should have left the luggage down and the bell boy would have helped. However it‚Äôs not advisable as the hotel is located beside a busy street. I was also told that there is an elevator which goes down. I tried to take it while checking out however the route was manually closed & I had to go up and again take the steps to go out. This is something which I think the hotel should be serious off and not pass on incorrect information to guest. The‚Ä¶Good place and nice rooms but the bed linen and the towels provided are absolutely poor Some are torn and smelly The houskeeping team is good but the materials they provide is worse. They even kept liquid soap in the moisturiser bottle in the toilet.Our group of nine consisting of retd. Syndicate Bank & spouses stayed in this hotel on 1st december This is good hotel.Though we reached quite late at around 10.30 pm they arranged for food for our group at a short notice offering a good discount.The complimentary breakfast was also good with a fairly well spread out menu.The rooms were good & well appointed .We enjoyed our stay there.Around 60 of our classmates booked 30 rooms in this hotel. Rooms are neat and food is good. Hotel is located in a central place. Only drawback is they could not serve bed tea and breakfast in time and properly to all 60 persons at a time. Need to organize things. However Staff members are courteous.This is place to stay and recommended.Huge building in the mid of Kakinada town.We went to have lunch,it was vegetarian spread in the buffet so we went up stair for Ala carte. Not a soul when we went strangely dark giving a very shady appearance. Too many people to take care. Food was just ok,highly overpriced for no reason.Nice property and easy to reach from Bus Stand, Railway Station, prime shopping area and Movie Theaters. Have a restaurant that serves tasty food. Friendly staff. overall a good experience. Good Ambience, spacious and comfortable rooms.here is very user friendly staff and tasty and quality food making chef. Unlimited buffet,no restriction on stay,maximum discounts available comparative other hotels.here is meeting halls and birthday function halls also available.Very near to road,bus and railway transport....so nice to stay in this hotal",0.3,1

Bur reception is very bad experience, I didn't have this type of reception experience earlier. House keeping I'd good and restaurant also good. But reception receiving and treatment is very bad. Needs improvement.I have booked this hotel just because it belongs to Daspalla Hotel group and was shock when i stepped into the hotel. Reception is the worst experience i have ever had in my entire travel history. It is such disgrace to the Groups name for choosing such a hotel to be their part of the groupHappy with rooms and house keeping. Food is good. Only issue is the too much time taken for serving food both in restaurant and to the room. Management should work on this issue. Otherwise it is really value for money.Yesterday I ordered food from Jaya Residency through Zomato App. The food delivered is worst of it's kind. Jaya Residency from the group of Daspallah is becoming a cheating restaurant. `taking the advantage of Pandemic - groups like Daspallah is cheating people with colluding with Zomato. Even there is no response from Zomato after i rated worst food delivered.The receiving of the staff and the reception was so bad. No comfortable for family's and the rude behavior of the staff. I didn't recognize any restaurant there and there was a worst experience for me.Hotel near to bus stand and heart of city. Good spacious 54 rooms, free WiFi, Restaurant at 1st floor. For sure have their South Indian meals. Complimentary breakfast well served. Have banquet halls. They have a bouquet shop so the entrance. Around 10pm also , there was rush at restaurant. Good people to stay withIt was my one night stay. Hotel has specious room and bathroom. Speciality vegetarian restaurant, dosha was very good. Friendly front office staff. Cleaning of room n hotel is maintained well. Veg thali was yummy.Based on word of mouth and previous experience, I had stayed there almost 15 50 16 years back, we decided that lets give it a try to stay in Jaya Residency once again. We had booked through Make My Trip the travel website. Once we checked in the smell hit us, then came the dirty bed sheets and worst was the curtains. I am sure that the curtains were not changed since the time it was fixed. Dirty with a lot of stains. My wife was feeling nauseated that she decided that we check out in the next 30 minutes after checking in. We spoke to the people at Make My Trip and explained out situation. The hotel staff tried convincing us by upgrading us to their suite room. It was as bad as the room that we were staying in. In the next few minutes we booked through MMT again and checked out.‚Ä¶This has been my go to place for more than 8 years due to the proximity to my place of work. Easy access, near to Bus station and Railway Station. Little aged hotel but neat and clean rooms. Complementary accessories are limited to soap and shampoo. Staff is courteous and welcoming. Order for room service if you prefer non-veg otherwise they only serve vegetarian in the restaurant. Free wifi is available, as usual speed is not that greatit is a nice place to stay in kakinada. Very nice staff and good vegetarian food.it is the one of the great vegetarian hotel. high classic rooms with family. you eat food in this hotel is good delicious tasty.But cost is moderate comparatively others.",0.32,1

However, when I arrived on 23rd Sept, the staff at the Reception claimed they had no information on my booking. Vaishali at the Reception had an attitude, was very rude and sarcastic and said it would take an hour for a room to be readied as Housekeeping staff had not yet reported for duty!

Neat beddings with good interiors and cupboards. Centralized air conditioning. Inhouse restaurant available. Room service is also there but with service charges. Room cleaning service team does a good job. The main attraction with the hotel is its location.A good hotel if you have less expectations. Small rooms, low spread of food. The breakfast spread especially was poor. It would be nice if the waiters could speak Hindi / English too (then it would be easier for non Andhraites to communicate).On the main road, easy to find. walkable from the nearest bus stop and easily reachable from Railway station. The ambience at reception is good, but hallways are not. Rooms are not roomy but for me, it is ok, as most of the time I would be outside on work and need only to take a good sleep at night. Food in nearby restaurant is good, Instead of room service better go to the restaurant. Room lighting could be better.

Morning breakfast was good and decent options were there. Only thing is that this hotel does not have Kitchen, we guess it is being shared with Hotel Manorama.

This property is in downtown of Vijayawada with lot of shopping/ eating options and there is a mall just opposite to the hotel. Road leading to hotel is crowded and too much of traffic and there is hardly a place to park vehicle to get down to check in. Having said Check-in and Check-out is quick & smooth and front office is helpful and efficient. Requested twin beds and they have considered and provided; Thank you. We drove down to hotel in chauffer driven car and there is no provision for driver rest room. As such we were informed that this facility is available when called two days before check in. Room service slow to respond and‚Ä¶Rooms are clean. Bathrooms are clean but do need to have a little better quality. Food is good. Breakfast spread was good. AC was really powerful. Good location and exactly opp PVP mall. Lot of good food options in the vicinityAll the major shopping malls, theatres, bus station, temples are very nearby. Tidy and hygiene place to stay. Room service is also okay. Restaurant at the ground floor, which is also okay. Reasonable prices for the stay.The reason I selected this hotel is because of their restaurant. Our family used to frequently eat out at Minerva in Hyderabad. Expecting the same experience I selected this hotel. I must say I was a little disappointed with the breakfast - the trademark taste was missing in everything offered - from chutneys to sambar to main course. I also had their vegetarian thali for lunch which was good. Other than this, the hotel is centrally located just next to a new mall which can be visited if found time. The hotel is very busy in the area mainly for its coffee shop and you always find it crowded. The rooms were clean and the stay was decent.Stayed with family on the occasion of a wedding @Hotel Minerva grand. the rooms are good, but ventillation is average. The Hotel is centrally located and is very close to PVP shopping mall. Vegetarian food is very goodI came for dinner with friends Minerva Grand hotel at lobby level coffee shop nice place for dining. staff was very good and courtious, food is excellent and good service and food suggested by Mrs sravanthi Mr Ashok ,Mrs lizaa,and staff behavior is good, thank u all uStayed for two days at this hotel and following are my observations.. 1. Shabby entrance. Some or the other construction always happening around entry/ reception area. 2. Small congested room. 3. Telephone placed way far away from bed. No bedside table. Always inconvenient to get up to order food etc. 4. No table and chair to sit and eat your food. 5. MOST GLARING AND RIDICULOUS.. MOST OF THE ITEMS ON ROOM SERVICE MENU..THE REPLY FROM STAFF IS.. NOT AVAILABLE.. 6. THERE IS A PART OF THE ROOM SERVICE MENU THAT SAYS.. ROUND THE CLOCK MENU.. BUT IF YOU ASK ROOM SERVICE FOR ANYTHING ON THAT, THEY SAY.. NO.. NOT AVAILABLE. 7. I was booked to check in on 28th Sept and Check out on 20th Sept. Are n 20th,Sept, the receptionist calls me at 8am to ask me my check out time..!!!. And‚Ä¶My wife and I stayed in room no. 214 of Minerva Grand for 3 nights in August. We checked in on 3rd and checked out on 6th. PROS: 1. The room is extra spacious with little ventilation from the side and good ventilation from the road side facing the mall. 2. Large spacious washroom 3. Enjoyable and tasty complimentary breakfast 4. Good service of the staff from room service, house keeping, bell by, front desk departments. 5. Very tasty Andhra Thali. 6. Free Wi-fi CONS: 1. The main reception door is off the street with absolutely no parking space 2. Damp smell in the room 3. Key card malfunctions all the time, so we need to seek the help from the housekeeping/reception 4. Permanent traffic jam in front of the hotel because of the mall located across the street 5. One morning‚Ä¶I say this hotel for one day really good everything is fine in this hotel I want to see again minimum budget hotel is a best hotel to stay with family everything is good thanks management team to make clean and greenThe restaurant is more popular than the hotel and hence the lobby where elevators are located is always crowded. The elevators are dirty. The rooms don‚Äôt have option of sunlight as the windows are fixed and covered with white plastic Rooms are ok Room service is good",0.34,2

Only Service ladies and boys r good at their service. Thank God.Very poorly maintained Hotel. Toilets are unhygienic. House keeping is bad.

It has a in-house restaurant AryaBhavan where the food is good but the service very slow.We were panicky about the flight after giving our food orders when we had to wait for endless minutes.Overall good not comfort, some cleanness not good and some washroom properties not available like water guns, showers, hand wash, tissues, Soaps, shampoo, Moisturizer, Dental kit, Shaving kit, this needs to keep @ room when guest entered in ROOM...............Stayed with family between 28th To 31st December . Rooms are too good. Service was excellent. Hotel is nearer to everything. We enjoyed Tiffins there more than lunch. Friendly staff. 5 minutes journey to bus station and Railway station.I stayed from 27th 30th. check in took 1.5 hrs as exhaust fans not working in old building. New building washbasin very small and granite projection for soap hits head while using wash basin. As promised not shifted to old building next day.

They are a self-certified 4 star hotel, which technically may be true but they do not deserve even one. The staff are the worst experience after the room and sanitation failures. We called multiple times before we booked and everything they said turned out to be lies when we reached there and their excuse - they do not even know who answered the phone and gave the information. The front office was on his own ego trip and the only language that they understand is if you shout at them. The rooms are not tidy and honestly claustrophobic. The corridors were not lit to save on electricity üò°ü§¨ The restaurant has no social distancing.. there was a group of 100 guests arriving for a function and were roaming around with the guests.. we‚Ä¶I stayed there multiple times, this time Enroute to Kakinada, we stopped there for food, Located at the beginning of IRR, near to nidamanru village and airport, Wash room are clean, service is prompt and food is good, overall it was a worth stop and good food at reasonable price,Pros: 1. Locartion is a plus, not too far from airport, and is located at the heart of the ciy. 2. Parking available 3. Food is good (I did not try the buffet) Cons: 1. Rooms can be cleaner 2. Price high for the standard of the place 3. Receptionist declined to provide additional/spare room access card...WTF?The hotel rooms are neat & clean! The daily housekeeping needs improvement! Room service is good! The restaurant is very good. They offer tiffin (snacks) items as well as a-la-carte menu in veg & non veg.section. Complimentary breakfast menu offered was good!The rooms were smelling like crap. Just not worth the money. Old bed Lenin, literally crappy pillows that were used for atleast a decade with no firmness. Overall crappy experience. Booked 2 rooms. After arriving there the hotel staff offers us one suite room and asks if we can adjust. The rooms were bad and they expect 4 adults and 2 kids to adjust with one bed. That tells you what you can expect from this hotel. Will never recommend this hotel to anyone.The Kay hotel at Vijayawada is well located.The rooms are spacious and well furnished. Amenities like electric kettle, mini fridge, hair dryer,LCD TV etc are provided. WiFi is available.Hotel has in house laundry.Airconditioning is good.There is a fitness center in the hotel.The staff can speak only local Andhra language and the language problem does exist.food is too spicy and oily. Better stick to basic dishes like dal and vegetables.Traffic in Vijayawada is maddening.I have stayed here a couple of times on trips to India. The hotel is very pleasant, well serviced and the food is great. It is of a high standard in every way. It is equipped with conference and gym facilities.I stayed just for less than 12 hours in this hotel, as a transit stay. We wanted to stay at a decent hotel which is safe and accessable. Kay hotel fits well on this count but is quite expensive. They charged 4500 for the room which they claim as superior room. It's a very basic room and the charge is quite high viz a viz the value that it offers. We wanted to leave at 7AM but the breakfast was not ready till 7.20. so we had to leave without breakfast. Somehow I felt the charge is quite high than value that it offers.The hotel is a mid range business hotel with not so great view from the room windows. However the rooms are spacious and cosy. the best part about the hotel is its restaurant. the spread in breakfast, lunch and dinner is phenomenal. the food is very good and the service is excellent. the staff is very cordial and friendly. all in all a very very good experience which I would like to repeat.Stayed for a couple of days at the Kay Hotel early this month. The hotel is located in a prime location, quite a close to the airport. Check in was easy. The room was spacious enough, and clean with fresh linens. Bathroom was a tad small, but well maintained. Adequate toiletries were provided. Rooms also have a locker to store valuables. The complimentary breakfast at the Orange restaurant near the lobby serves a decent spread. Food is mostly good. Room service was also prompt. However, the room service staff could do with more training. Overall, it's a great place to stay. It could do better with an improvement in food quality.",0.4,1

Does not deserve the cost it charged. A very ordinary room should cost 1/3 of the price charged. Would never recommend this hotel to anyone. Could not sleep whole night due to mosquitos.My experience in the executive room was disappointing. I had to request for every thing, from soap and shampoo to towels even for door mats. The TV is not working. After multiple calls, I did get soap, shampoo and 2 towels. 1 of the towels is torn and having some brown coloured marks. Even after 2 hours and multiple requests TV is still not working.I have stayed around 1 week , key card of room not worked, TV not working, no laundry facility, breakfast not tasty and we have to beg for towel, soap etc. 2.

I made an advance reservation for the room and in fact arrived quite earlier than i informed on 1st Nov (around 3 PM), but still the check-in was very smooth and the room was ready within no time. Same day we had a very blissful Darshan of Amma Varu at Kanaka Durgamma Temple atop the hill. I asked front desk people for a taxi car for my next day's visit to Mopidevi Subramanya Temple and i was instantly provided with contact details of their trusted travel and tour operator M/s MK Tours and Travels owned by one Mr Murali, who is very polite and gentle to talk to.

However, it lacks the basic needs of a family traveler. Poorly maintained property, no parking, poor food, zero ventilation bring down the overall experience of a traveler.

The food is extremely great and need not have to search other places.Hotel manorama is being heart of the city in Vijayawada makes things easier and comfortble. Thank you very much for providing such kind of stuff to make my travel very happy. I will definitely try visit this place again.This is more like a restaurant than a hotel. Has nice interiors. Food quality was good. Lots of lodges near this hotel too. Cost is like a regular restaurant. Ideal place for good food. The area is very calm with less traffic. Parking is available nearbyWe had stayed in their deluxe rooms for 2 nights. Positives: Hotel in the city center. Their Veg restaurant has good food . Not very spicy. Breakfast had some good spread and they are flexible in timing. Though they open the buffet breakfast at 7.30 am, we were there at 6.45 am and almost all items were ready by then except for a few. Negatives: When we staying there, there is a work going on to build additional lift. Absolutely no safety concerns for the customers around and the drilling has been going on with stone pieces falling around and about to hit my friend. Maintenance of the rooms is not upto the mark. Washbasins had cracks allover.the hotel centrally located 10 years ago we stayed on the same hotel with blissful facilities and cleanliness ... now interiors are old and no proper cleanliness .. food is good as always...service need to improve ..They call themselves 3star. But not worth for rating. Though front office staff is courteous, general manager is too busy with personals, to listen to customer woes. Room condition pathetic and don't be surprised that room service staff will knock at mid night for food billüòÉ settlement. Not recommended for family stayStayed for night in connection with business trip. Location is central and cellar bar/restaurant is fine. Rooms and rest of facilities though show lack of care and maintenance (malfunctioning shower, broken tiles etc) and overall the place looks filthy. Affordable, if you're prepared to deal with the shortcomings.It is located within 2 KM's from railway station. In a strategic place near the market. Convenient to travel from here to any place near Vijayawada. Stayed for a day . Did not have food. But there is a separate vegetarian restaurant. Value for money but needs lot of improvement in maintenance. !. Overall rating is good . Just made it to that scale.Stayed here for 2 nights with family. Room is extremely crammed for space. Maintenance is non-existent. The doors do not close. Washroom is so horrible. Looks like it has been ages since they have cleaned these rooms properly. I did not get booking in Minerva Grand and hence had to go with this one. The beds are too high for my elderly parents to get onto. Room service takes such a long time. You do get complimentary breakfast for online bookings. They do a good job when it comes to valet parking.",0.32,0

First i put up there in 2015 Dec when was returning on my bike,solo, from Puri to Pune. Vijaywada was recently declared as Capital of AP. Enjoyed my stay in the Hotel. Loved the best is location. Is just right on the junction of NH5 & NH8. Value for money. Both the times rooms i got were spacious and comfortable. Food is also good with complimentary breakfast. This time , Dec 2019 i was travelling with Family Bhubaneswar to Bengaluru. Even my wife & Son loved the place. Somehow i could not make till Vijaywada in Nov2017, else this would have been my 3rd stay, that time i was on my car with Mom, Dad and Granny.During Road trip from Vizag to Hyderabad found on the net and enjoyed the stay for break at this property well maintained and food is awesome. Parking is little cumbersome because of highway rush but quite easy to reach without wasting time during Journey. Loved their hospitality. ThanksWhile the hotel has good infrastructure, but lot is desired in terms of house keeping. The rooms are spacious, well laid out. Staff is helpful, but a lot is required on the grooming and professional outlook front. The restaurant served good delicious food, here the staff is really good. They make right recommendations are always there to serve.The room is good.. staff is good The minor flaws include 1.unusually placed tap in the wash basin... very difficult to use 2. Absence of coffee maker and hair dryer 3. Old mirror in the bath room But the hotel is clean and well msintainedWell connected and right on the main road. Taxi and rickshaw would be available right outside the hotel. Opted for the executive room.decent bed with TV in the room and adequately lit. The bathroom is huge and clean. Facilities like soap, shampoo, towel are provided by the hotel. Shower and hot water facility is available. The hotel also provides faculty like tea and coffee sachets and you could prepare your own whenever need be. Newspaper is provided in the morning. WiFi is free of cost although I did not make use of it. The complementary breakfast could have been better with very limited options. All in all a good stayFamily of four booked two rooms. Allotted #316 and 317 while checking in at around 9pm. The rooms are decent in all aspects. But the big problem is sound. You feel traffic noise in the room as though you are Standing on side of a busy road. On the top of it, when we were trying to get sleep, at 10:30pm, front office rang the Phone and told us to move to rooms in 4th floor. How lame and arrogant that was to call at 10:30pm!! One can stay here if the purpose is not a might‚Äôve sleep.We stayed there for 3 nights as a wedding party. A decent hotel to stay with family and friend with nice location. The staff and specially the Manager Srinivas is very very helpful and supportive. However we lost few things and on our repeated request they could not show us the recording of CCTVs until we left. There were enough numbers of CCTV Cameras and we could have easily established if the item lost was from room or elsewhere but they could not show the recording. This caused the doubt in our mind and also they loose the credibility. Food And service is good. Second problem is too much noise from the main roads on both sides of hotel.A nice place to stay and easily accessible from anywhere. Close to airport. Supportive and helpful staff. Rooms and bathrooms are clean and well maintained. Lighting a bit low in the rooms. Food is good.Hotel Innotel is located at a convenient location beside the highway at a distance of 20 minutes from the airport. It's situated at a 3way junction on the front and a highway at the back. But the location is also a disadvantage which you realize while you try to sleep. There is continuous movement of traffic and along with the traffic comes the honking. There was practically no sleep through the night. Stayed at the suite room (205).The room was big but lacked maintenance. But the morning breakfast was great. Though the menu was limited, the quality of food was very good. All in all an average hotel and should be considered if no other decent midrange hotels are available. Finding decent midrange hotels in Vijaywada can be challenging at times.Very good place. Good staff clean rooms convenient good house keeping. Good front office staff Restaurant is good. Near to airport 20 minutes. Check in and check out fast. Car parking available Clean and neat",0.4,1

Thanking youPillow covers are soiled so are bed sheets, issues with geysers too... Otherwise room is ok for short stay Location is good The hotel is currently undergoing some renovation which was not listed in the treebo app or websiteConveniently near the railway station. The rooms were clean and comfortable enough and value for money. Avoid rooms near the lift as it makes noise all night. The wifi was strong with a reasonable internet connection.I had a best stay over there had a good breakfast.and the staff was so welcoming I will surely recomend this hotel.the location is also very nearby to the station and bus stand. I will surely stay in the same place for my next visitIt was a bad experience. You have to remind them even to get your complementary water bottles:the complimentary breakfast was of worstcquality:and the dining area environment was too bad.they didn't even bother to give anotice average quality coffee.I stayed with two of my family members:never they gave us three towels.they gave us one towel on first day and two towels on second day;they said they had some laundry issues.They have to improve on many fronts,.this property is close to vijayawada railway station:that is the only plus pointHappen to stay for a day trip. Hotel is nearby to railway station and hence easily accessible. Rooms are small and clean. Hotel does not have own restaurant but opposite side a very good restaurant is located.I really didn't expect this from treebo, because of my good earlier experiences.This time it's really bad. Rooms aren't clean. Bathroom isn't hygiene either. It's just over priced too. At around 1500 Rs, I could have got much better room. Basically hotel looks old with no makeover.In correct Menu cards served , costly food but no taste. Extra bed was not good. Room was filled with cigar smell , not properly perfumed before handing over to us. Though we checked in at 7 pm.

Me and my friends loved it. The best and wonderful place to visit and people like nikhil make it much better. Woahh..... the best ever and we enjoyed it .Writing this review the very first day of my two night stay here. To start with it was a very unwelcoming experience at the front desk. Rude and unprofessional people ensure that you will lose all charm of staying in the property. They act like a lodge asking for advances. We were unable to order even for room service because they put a ""No Post"" charges option on the room. For removing it they demand pre authorization. Something they never tell about while checking in. I have one moer night stay to go. Will update on overall experience post that.This hotel doe not see International standards of cleanliness. I cannot believe that a ""5 star"" hotel can be this worn down and dirty. The carpets in the hallway smell foul and there are stains all over the rooms even on the tiles. Really disappointing, I had to propane my trip. Luckily I was on a business trip just for two days and cut it down to one day.Whiskey sour smelled of rotten eggs. Pina colada arrived an hour late, that too without alcohol. We decided to skip ordering mains looking at the way the servers were running around like headless chickens. Have no issues to pay for the overpriced items, but the quality is bad and service is worse.Very very nice hotel This hotel room is very good, the bed room is very good, the facility of food and accommodation in this hotel is very good.My friends said that they liked it very much after visiting that hotel, all facilities are there in that hotel with family.I would have rated this place 10-star if possible. We recently held our leadership conference in Vizag at the Novotel. While many things go in curating a world class experience n a conference, one of the most critical element is the hotel. The quality of rooms, service quality and of course the quality of food. The team at Novotel rose above and ensured that every leader had a superlative experience. The location of this hotel is simply awesome. A hip-skip-jump from the beach, and with most rooms facing the sea, you will be getting up to the view of a magnificent sunrise everyday. Enjoy the stay!",0.38,2

Rooms are not cleaned properly.not worth for money. I requested for room shifting for that i waited for 45 mins at outside of my room and i requested for bathroom slippers it took more than 45 mins and also for tv complaint technician came after 20mins. Shower in bathroom is horrible it's sound like a bug. Not at all happy with my stay i never suggest this hotel to any one. It's 5 star hotel but service like a Oyo. Small hotels are better then this propertyThis hotel has remained its charm year after year, and that's why we keep coming back here again. The rooms are spacious and comfortable, and the wide windows offer a wonderful view over the garden, which is located on the beach side. From our window we could see the charming pool area. The breakfast service was excellent and there was a lot to choose from. You could also order omelets and our favorite was the Indian omelette. The coffee was good. However, Park Hotel's absolute advantage is its unique, truly beautiful garden. It's no wonder that many celebrations such as weddings are organized there. The hotel has its own beach. However, due to the strong waves swimming on the beach is prohibited, but you can swim in the pool. The swimming pool area is in excellent condition‚Ä¶The food and destination was great, the arrangement was helpful! Mr Nagesh and Mr Sadiq helped us with the early check in and event flow! Everyone loved the destination, decor and the ambience! We will definitely visit this place againGreat place to stay great room , great service. View from room was awesome. You can sit at the beach side restaurant the shack and enjoy the relentless sound of wave and witness the beauty of bay of bengal.This was our first visit to Vizag and we weren‚Äôt sure about the properties, at the time of reservation. We booked the Park for 4 nights and another 5 star property for another two. But how I wish, we could‚Äôve stayed the whole length of our stay @ Park, Visakhapatnam. The location, the hospitality, and the food - this hotel has the best to offer in the city. Dinner at the sea side restaurant, ‚ÄúThe Shack‚Äù was sumptuous and the ambience divine! A special thanks to the Director Operations, Mr Jaydeep Biswas, who was available 24x7 and was always forthcoming to make our vacation the most enjoyable one. Would recommend this property to everyone who visits Visakhapatnam.I was in vishakapatnam for two days and the park has made it the most memorable time for me and my wife . Awesome ambience, great support team , great party place (DJ night) . Not a single point where we can say this they need to improve. I will recommend whoever is visiting vishakapatnam should stay at this hotel atleast for a night and enjoy . The support staff specially Mr. Ramesh was very polite and generous. I am thankful to the hotel to give me such good experience .During our Vizag vacation, stayed at The Park for 4 nights. The property is bang on the beach and boasts of lush, well manicured gardens. The view of the gardens followed by the sea from the rooms is pure bliss. You can hear the waves crashing on to the shore while you dine at the beachside restaurant, The Shack. A big thumbs up to the General Manager, Mr. Biswas, who looks into the minutest details and allays all your concerns. He spared his time and shared with my inquisitive 11 year old, stories about Vizag and AP. A special mention to Mr. Arun at the restaurant and Mr. Thomas at the front desk for making our stay even more comfortable. Didn‚Äôt feel like leaving‚Ä¶We‚Äôll surely be back soon.1. Most rude staff behavior. Mostly all 2. ZERO maintenance 3. Ill treatment with guests 4. No facilities as mentioned were provided 5. Below average rooms 6. Broken lights at swimming pool 7. Common area bathrooms stinking & messy OVERALL a 2 star property. I informed of these to property manager Mr. Dinesh. Let's see what are his corrective actions.Our initial 3 night stay began with a slight hiccup but post that it was a breeze. Full marks to Mr. Biswas (General Manager) and the staff Arun, Vipin, Thomas, Ramana and Suresh (housekeeping) for making it such a pleasant experience. The GM of the property himself is a very courteous man and is a one stop solution for all the travel and city related querirs. As far as the property goes, yes it is old, but at times vintage has a charm that the newer properties amiss. However, they are planning a renovation. The hospitable gesture of the staff in upgrading us to a deluxe suite 401, was indeed very very gratifying. It even has a personal balcony and seating space. Food is by far supreme here and major meals and breakfast are a lavish and scrumptious spread. The staff is happy‚Ä¶",0.52,2

The rooms are also infected with cockroaches. The teacups in the room where not cleaned. Overall a pretty bad experience.We have booked 2 rooms for 6 Adults as usual check in was okay and our packages include one major meal so we planned to take dinner as major meal and in afternoon we have decided to go for alacart but the lunch was terrific started with munchow soup it's the worst even a local food stall quality was better than this . We have ordered American corn it's quality was ok .next coming to main course the dal makni was very good but the panner preparation was not upto the level and the mainly the service it's very slow like they are working forcefully when we have ordered one extra naan they delivered it after 15 min when we complain regarding they they reply sir asu are taking lunch very late so it will take time. Time was 3 pm .if u can't serve u should tell from the starting .‚Ä¶A very nice property, located at a convenient location. The checkin and check out experience was great and the room lovely. Breakfast buffet is a wide spread of dishes. A wonderful place to stay. The Service at both the Bar and the restaurant was attentive and good. I would recommend the place for a holiday stay as well as for a business visit.With the typical trappings of the Taj group, The Gateway Hotel at Beach Road in Vizag lures you with excellent service, warm staff members, rooms with a sea view and a nicely landscaped property. The location is excellent as well.Wonderful experience with an excellent memory. I visited with my family and we enjoy ourselves a lot. overall experience is very good. Prachi is a very helpful executive she helps us with a lot, she manages baby sitter and tries to give us an excellent experience. Other executives are also very helpful. The Pnabul & other executives are very polite and cooperative.Been here with family. Pros: - Check in and check out has been smooth with minimal wait time. Staff are helpful with minor requests with extra beds or linen. - Pool overlooks the beach. - Prime location. - Rooms are clean, spacious enough for a small family with in room amenities like tea / coffee/ mini snacks, hair dryer, safety locker and mini fridge. Cons : - Plce is worn out..most comkon areas like the lobby, pool, spa, restaurants need an upgrade as look and feel worn out. - Food in breakfast buffet has a good spread, but taste is ok. - Beds are queen sized and would be small for family of three (kid) . Would expect a king sized bed in a five star hotel of this stature. Overall a good stay.The Hotel is very old and badly needs renovation. Room furniture, especially writing table, drawer etc., have become outdated. I am a Taj Inner circle member. Had booked room with a partial view of the sea and beach. Requested the front reservation person to upgrade me but he did not respond. The lift used to visit the GAD Restaurant is making such a sound while landing, it sounds like it may breakdown any moment. Even the quality and varieties of food available were very limited when compared to Taj standard. When asked for a few drinks of my choice in the Bar, they did not have them. Only a very limited options in single malt or good whisky May be they will improve in future!!!We visited Taj Gateway , Vizag in January 23 and had a very pleasant experience on all fronts. The Bay of Bengal is just opposite the hotel. One can go for morning walks on the shore and still be on time for the breakfast. Location of the hotel is so good that you can inhale fresh cool sea breeze at all times and feel charged. They have a very good spa as well. Room service, housekeeping, Travel and front desk works very efficiently to meet visitors personalized requirements. Food is good in sll the restaurants and the chefs pay lot of attention to customize the menu. The front desk works seamlessly at all times. Airports transfer very well handled as well . Overall it's worth a second visit.Very good experience, quick response by front office, fast room service, quality of food amazing, value of money, beautiful views, walking distance to RK beach I had preponed the check out and hotel refunded my amount immediately.Overall 10 out of 10The best part of Taj group of hotels is excellent service and 'Never to say No' attitude. Everything was fantastic including food, view from the room, proximity to beach. Everything was very well managed. New year Eve was an outsourced activity to third party but we felt it was not of the Taj standards. We found lobby area is good. However interiors of each room and carpets on individual floor aisle is definitely dated and need to be renovated. We love Taj properties and will look forward for next visit.",0.48,0

The staff was very courteous and made us feel at home. The food was delicious and the hotel also arranged a cab for us at a good price for sightseeing. Overall, it was a great stay and I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable and enjoyable stay.Clean hotel with clean rooms. Restaurant with decent food and room service. Everything was perfectly maintained. The only problem I found was that there was a moldy smell in the room that they tried to cover with a air freshener. They need to air out the room and the mattress and clean the drapes to make the room smell fresh.Very proactive management who work tirelessly to elevate the experience. Also, it is one of few pet friendly places in Andhra Pradesh. Management also ensured we got a cab which agreed to take us and our dog to Araku day trip. That was really wow. Very enjoyable stay. Loved the breakfast spread as well.I suggest this property for both business stay and family stay. Excellent hospitality and food quality and taste. Executive director was always on the floor and reachable at all times.... Had a really happy stay at the property Quite reachable to cityWe visited Vizag for the long weekende of Independence day and chose Hotel winsar for our two nights stay in Vizag. We were a group of 10 people and three toddlers. the whole experience was smooth rather very very pleasant. The location is near RK beach as perfect as it can be. First comes booking process, which was very smooth and they assured we won't face any trouble while travelling with little toddlers. As promised, the service was beyond satisfactory. They were literally 'one call away'. The bathroom and rooms were always neat and clean. Food was sumptuous. The breakfast buffet was my personal favourite, the live dhosa and omelette counter was super hit. They helped us in booking cars and planning our further trips too. The behaviour of all the staffs were really‚Ä¶Recently did a road trip from Bhubaneswar to Vizag (around 1000 km both ways) with family. Trip was excellent. Booked a room for 3 nights at Winsar park. This was the 2nd time we were staying there after 7 years. It is still one of the best hotels in Vizag with a reasonable budget. At 7000 per night, they alloted the king suite ... excellent rooms with sumptuous breakfast. We even ordered ala cart for lunch and dinner . very reasonable and tasty. The management is very helpful and will go out of their way to make you feel at home.The hotel is run very professionally. . The morning breakfast buffet that they serve is just amazing. Online booking, pickup, drop facility, guided tours all available, centrally located, near the beach and very near to the centre of the city. Overall a very good experience for me and my family.It was a reunion of course mates. The focus was on the function. The peripherals would not have mattered, but for the exemplary service provided by the Manager and staff who made our trip such a great event. Probably, out of my five days of stay, there was not a single day I could resist myself from thanking the Manager and appreciating the staff for all they did for us. A. The check in was done without a hastle. The owner father son duo has such a great chemistry, wish Ambanis would have learnt a lesson.üôÇ B. The sumptuous and very refreshing breakfast was greeted by the smiles of two professional waitress. That itself is sufficient for the day. C. The rooms were maintained and cleaned on a daily basis. The housekeeping is superb. D. Our trip was made special more so because‚Ä¶Conveniently located within 1 km distance from the beach. Rooms are standard and cleaned in afternoon. Complementary breakfast is quite sumptuous. We took the cab from the hotel and he was quite kind enough to show us the city and Araku valley for our 3 day stay.A few minutes away from the RK Beach, we will remember this hotel for their amazing hospitality, politeness and service. Whether it was about enquiring about every member of the group, to catering to every request, to customising the food on the menu to our taste, they went beyond their duty. We were a big group and all of us loved our stay with Winsar Park. Would recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to Vizag. The highlight of our stay was the food, and the behaviour of the staff in the hotel. We overate, and hated leaving when the trip was over!",0.3,2

Good service.This is a centrally placed property, very near to station and around 20-25 mins from the airport. The famous Jagadamba junction is just around the corner. Then the CMR mall, RK beach, INS Kusura etc. are pretty near. The food is good here for both the breakfast buffet and the in-room service. The staff here is very polite and helpful. The only reason for not giving 4 star is the condition of the rooms. Lemon Tree really need to invest in the renovation of the hotel. The main door locks are jammed, some switches don't work, the wood work is coming out.",0.56,2

I find that in spite of being an age old hotel of Visakhapatnam, it had maintained or continuing to maintain the infrastructure very well. The up keep of rooms is quite good with neat and tidy rooms. Staff, the front desk, bell boys, housekeeping staff are well experienced, courteous and at your service at all times. The restaurant is maintaining the same, great food standards over the last 30+ yearsIts a very good hotel and friendly atmosphere. We enjoyed the Non-Veg food. So many varieties of food and clean rooms ans well maintained staff. Its worth for the money. Best choice. Enjoyed the amenities swimming pool, steam bath and sauna bath.Thank you so much for all the arrangements and the best food provided. We had the best time, staff was so prompt and provided best professional service. The one item we felt was too spicy is fish curry. Else we enjoyed everythingWe have celebrated our daughter's half saree ceremony in Dasapalla Vedika. Staff are really helpful. Especially Ramakrishna garu supported us very well. We are NRIs so we had to completely rely on him to organise the event for us. Thank you Ramakrishna garu and thanks to Dasapalla's staff.We celebrated our traditional function at the banquet with our beloved guests to whom the ambience was good and food was excellent. We recommend to go for the banquet as it lightens up there celebrationsWent to Vizag with family and stayed in Daspalla Vizag for a couple of days. Feels great to be welcomed with staff being polite and understanding. Rooms are clean and very well maintained. I am a vegeterian and love FOOD. The restaurant in the Hotel serve Pure vegeterian with a Multi Cuisine dishes. Very tasty and yummy food. Entire family enjoyed the food and kids loved it. Its like 2 Kms from the beach which makes it easy to take a morning walk in the beach.I was on visit to Vizag on an official assignment wit my wife. The hotel received us with a friendly Greet. I had booked in advance & no problem of waiting. All staf members from security, house keeping, room service were very polite & courteous.

All the museums are a stone's throw from here. Also Ramkrishna Beach is 2 kms and can be easily walked.The beach in-front of the hotel (Palm beach) is far better than dirty RK beach. Coming to food,their buffet breakfast was sumptuous,tasty,fresh,filling with a wide variety of options.We didn't feel hungry till 3PM after having that heavy breakfast. Overall their food quality is quite good and since the hotel position is premium,food price is also on the higher side. What this hotel lacks is hospitality and room service. Room cleanliness is not at par with the charge which is quite high. In spite of taking full charge of 3 adults they will arrange a floor mattress‚Ä¶located just near the beach, the higher rooms gives a full view of the beach. room size and service is good. breakfast if also good. checkin was smooth and so was the checkout. cleanness was good. overall goodThe hotel is located right at the beach road providing a good view of the sea. The room are decently maintained. The room service for food was pretty fast and the food was tasty. The staffs were quite cordial and well behaved. The best part is that there are doors connecting side-by-side rooms making is very suitable for two close families travelling together. As for us, my brother and my family travelled together thus we requested the hotel to unlock the door in between. That made two rooms interconnected.We were a group of 3 female friends who booked stay for 2 days in this hotel. We arrived by 8.30 pm to hotel for checkin. Check in process took 20 mins, the receptionist Mr. Srinivasan was very slow, continuously talking on phone. After checkin, he did not ask anyone to take our luggage, just handed over our keys and wifi passwords and told us room number. So we carried our luggage by ourselves and went to room. Now the first problem of room was, even after keeping AC on for 30 mins, on 22 degrees there was no cooling. Staff told us to keep temperature at 16 degrees only. Then came second problem, there was only luke warm water in tap, there was no solution to this prpblem for 2 daya of our stay. Third and biggest problem started at 5 am in morning. We woke up for getting‚Ä¶Had memorable stay here! This property has rooms with sea view and staff is also friendly ! And helpful and perfect place to spend 2-3 days at vizag ! Love the vibe here and perfect location because it has street nearby which directly around beachüòçloved the stay hereThe hotel is on RK Beach, known for its sea facing views. I booked a sea facing room, & was happy was this decision. The views were simply great especially the sunrise in the morning. The beach, the waves & INS kurusura submarine were all in view from the window. The room was neat & comfortable. Only the washroom was a bit on smaller side, could have been more spacious. Breakfast dint feel that great, could have been better. Service in all aspects was pretty good. Value for money. I Recommend it for the views & a comfortable stay:)This hotel is an old one but well maintained. The location is really very good. Beach front room if booked, you will be baffled with the sea view. They placed a large glass opening to the room and mornings/evenings are highly enjoyable from the room. When you go, better to ask for beach view room. I think only 2 floors have rooms. The other floors have a restaurant, banquet hall, function hall, and the top floor, vacant. Anyway, good beach view, near the YMCA or Submarine museum.Abhorrent experiences. 1st day of my stay they served very nice. but from the next day the behaviour of room attended as well as the manager even the receptionist were very heart ful. i forgotten the facilities of 3 star hotel after their behaviours. insects in the almira which kept in my room was full of insects which damaged my new shirt an pant. after calling the manager came after 1 hour. he did not have any reaction over this matter. on 6.12.19 night the cocktail party on the roof top with excessive sound of DJ ohoo so miserable. my little child could not sleep whole night for their DJ sound. is this the 3 star hotel Ambica??? I must recommend for every one that not to stay at Ambica. and I must take legal steps accordingly after return. D.Biswas...7797401403Location: Excellent. Right opposite the beach. However, not too many eating options outside Rooms: Clean and comfortable rooms. I booked the premium room with sea view. Note that the sea view in such rooms is a side room view and not front view which I anticipated. The washrooms are clean with all the basic amenities Food: We ate at the restaurant and the food is of good quality and quantity. Warm staff and quick service. The breakfast spread is also good. Would recommend this place if you are in Vizag for a few days. Good place to stay with family with the submarine museum close by.The only good thing about this hotel is its location. Else it very badly maintained hotel. Old dirty towels, flies in the rooms and on the food, old bathrooms, uncomfortable beds. The ac vents seem to be not cleaned for ages. Air coming out of them is dirty. There is not much air circulation in the hotel and hence it always has a awry smell. Poor design when it comes to air circulation. A feeling of suffocatoin in the rooms.",0.28,2

I did not eat the complimentary breakfast as I had to checkout early.Helpful staff, clean room and bathroom, and OK breakfast, WiFi. More breakfast options would be nice. WiFi speed could be better but its more than good enough compared to many other places. Overall I am very happy with the stay.Don't go by photos. It's very basic hotel, an appartment converted to hotel & doesn't look as tidy as shown in photos. Ok if you just need a place to sleep for a day. There is no restaurant so you would have to order from zomato or Swiggy.One of the best area in Visakhapatnam, near to almost all tourist places. Well maintained. Friendly staff. Breakfast is ok, but when served immediately at 8AM before 9AM. Wifi is okay, but not high speed.

The Front Office and housekeeping staff are excellent and so are bell boys. I would like to mention Prasanna ( at reception), she was really kind and helpful. Rooms are neat and clean with city and houses view. Language is a little barrier. If you are a Telugu, or can converse in the language, then you would roll. What is severely lacking here is good food. If you are booked here, breakfast is complimentary but the spread is really sad. Also, we tried the bar and restaurant here...Oh God, you don't want to be here for food definitely. We ordered chicken malai and paneer tikka. The former was half cooked and latter just average. Drinks were awful. We ordered Baccardi Breezer and we got some local one, which tasted like‚Ä¶Very good. Comfortable stay. Staff is very good. Food is good. Overall experience is very good. The room service is very good. I would like to stay during my next visit. Location is also very good. Overall excellent.Nice experience very cozy and comfortable food are delicious a lot of Verity only one suggestion please provide news paper and story books I requested to the receptionist to provide news paper or a story book in English or Hindi she told me to provide but she didn'ti am a frequent traveler to vizag and most of the time i prefer to stay at daspalla, suryabagh which never disappointed me even once. i stayed in daspalla executive court around 9 yrs back. during my stay in the last week, i felt that the standards have been deteriorated and they are nowhere near their prime daspalla hotel at suryabagh. right from lobby to lift, it needs to be refurbished. food is not up to the mark. the served in lunch before day is being offered in breakfast on the next day. i requested HK to provide me a comb, to my dismay it is not in sealed and brought from a nearby pan shop. food is average/Location is well connected with Railway station, shopping and Hospitals. I want to give my feedback on Room service which is very much poor and needs to be improved. One instance ordered for omelet and came after 35 Minutes after repeated phone call. 2nd instance : Order for a morning tea but again came after 30 Minutes. 3 rd : Complimentary water bottle: Being the regular visitor to 3,5 star hotels, I can find 2 Ltrs of water bottle even for a single accommodation in most of the hotels where as in your hotel after being paid for 3 adults, got only 1 Ltr water bottle as a complimentary. This needs to be checked, surveyed with other hotels can be improved.Stayed here for one day. Central Location. The Room was clean and sanitised(which is essential during these Covid times). The Front Desk was friendly. Food was tasty. Barring a couple of hours of sounds from construction or modification work going in the floor alloted, rest of my stay was peaceful and comfortable. I would surely recommend it. If you are coming with family, this is a good option.Not sure whether they've cut on qualified staff due to COVID situation but I had the worst experience of my life in any classy star hotel. I ended up getting frustrated each day of my stay of 14 days.In this restaurant waiters don't have manners they don't lesson any thing like dabba hotels me my friends setting a corner behind the hand wash one waiter taking about us he doing like a dabba if some one tell any things he irritate what is this iam not taking any free things I'mpaying Food is good But i don't like waiter and manager Manager also didn't lesson any things he also standing like a doll After finish my food iam asking the finger bowl but the waiter says hand wash here only go wash your hands he told like this this is One of good property maintaine well guys don't do like that Iam very sad say this thingsThe hotel is centrally located and the beach is just a couple of kilometres away. Right from the moment you step into the lobby, you feel a bit cramped for space. The room was spacious but there was a bad smell inside the room and had to request housekeeping to spray room freshener to get rid of the smell. The food in the restaurant was awesome. The breakfast spread was also good, but the ambiance in the breakfast area for hotel guests was sort of dingy. I hope the management pays attention to these issues.The location is good, amenities are satisfactory, but rooms got no view and the hotel is very unprofessional when it comes to billing. After two weeks and multiple emails, still did not get any invoice or any response from the hotel.",0.4,2

The Reception and Restaurant staffs were friendly and courteous. Kiran Kumar and his team deserve a pat on their shoulders for their hardwork and dedication. Thanks for making our stay a memorable one.There are so many things wrong with this place. 1. Rude Staff: The manager here is very rude and talks with guests as if we were his workers. 2. Terrible Service: The housekeep and room service is not so good either.. even after repeated calls, either no one picks up or blantantly ignores the requests. 3. Unreasonable Pricing: Even small things are overcharged here.. A liter of water bottle would cost you nearly 50, and cup of tea would cost you 70.. which is available in 5 rupees out side.. and breakfast that is not even that good will cost you 300 per person. 4. Unprofessional place: The check out experience was terrible. Not only were they trying to charge a 1000 rupees for being slightly late (10 minutes) for check out, but also accuse you of something you didn't do (In my‚Ä¶‚ÄúI‚Äôve ordered dessert Elachi Gulab Jamun and they brought me one ball, for the price 120 INRüòÇ.

Food is also tasty that was provided in the breakfast with good options. Room was clean and had a good space to go around. Overall I give five stars for our comfortable stay.We recently had a committee meeting with dinner here. The vegetarian and non-vegetarian starters were fantastic, beyond my expectations.The staff was very helpful,especially a senior man named Mr.Mohan. The food and service was fantastic.The Port Hotel is situated in my work area in Visakhapatnam. I find the entire team of hotel staff and management very courteous. The rooms are neat. The veg food is good. It's located close to the railway station and in a prime location. Beach is not far from here.Here goes my honest unpaid review! I booked the room all in a hurry while I decided to extend my Stay in Visakhaptnam! Initially my experience with APTDC Haritha beach resort was not very pleasant.This one was clearly a winner in terms of value for money.Through #tripadvisor i got the room almost in 40% discounted price. The very first impression was ""excellent"" about the theme of this hotel that portray the true ambiance of a port life.My room was little small but over all decor and amenities was exceeded my Expectations, especially the bath room with cubicles in it. Location wise it is almost in central area where you can easily reach nearest mall and movie theater within 10 minutes walk-in distance (i am movieholic).I usually search for local food in any new place.But this‚Ä¶It was nice to stay in an hotel with line to your profession The management had kept in mind the way to create the feel with the right ambiance and props it was truly a great experience . The food and staff were polite and help full True value PramodMy favourite part about the Port hotel is the aesthetics- it looks cute and I was sold by the photos on the website. I was here for a work trip and they gave me a decent discount. I thought the service was pretty good for the price I paid! Tried the Kodi kura chicken at the restaurant and it was yum!

If someone is into hospitality industry then he should have been polite and he behaved as if he was doing charity and we lived freely. Don't know whether it would affect and would open eyes or not for others . But really a terrible experinece with family . Don't know whether these reviews are going to the Owner or not . Pls teach some etiquettes to your staff. Seeing the reviews we went there but the service and staff behaviour has really disheartened us. Being a frequent traveller would never suggest my friends and family for this hotel.Painting was going on and even my luggage bag was also had color on it but i did not complaint about that alsoHotel is located in the centre of the city well maintained rooms and staff, break fast is also good, nice hospitality and good ambience room service is also good and beach is also near by to 1.5 km over all experience is good.Good stay good Hospitality , Very good room service and house keeping also very nice. And fully enjoyed with family, and also every shopping malls hotels are available by near five elements. Room service are very fast and neat. And food service also very good taste. Thank you five elements.We went for a holiday to Vizag in December with friends. I was looking for a good budget hotel near the beach and found five elements. I was pleased with the courteousness of the staff and the cleanliness of the rooms. The rooms were basic but very well maintained and most importantly clean, the location of the hotel is very accessible and close to the beach. I would definitely visit again when I visit Vizag.Amenities, Room ambience are above average. Hotel is Located in heart of the city and surrounding by the hospitals. It is easily accessible to the beach, railway station and bus stand. But, hotel staff not following the COVID protocols, no one warning face mask. No temperature check at entrance of the hotel. Hotel having only one entry and same used for exit also. No fire safety measures and no fire escape route. In addition to the above, hotel is fully closed with glasses and no fresh air flow into the hotel building and rooms. In covid situation hotel become a hotspot for spreading of the COVID Vires . Hotel building also covered with full of buildings except entrance side. It‚Äôs not advisable to stay in the hotel in view of COVID-19 spreading and lack of fire safety‚Ä¶Small hotel at a prime location on Waltair main road, the hotel did not meet expectations. Room, quality of bed, pillows and linens were good. Bathroom was too small and could be better maintained. I had an unexpected visitor, my nephew, who had to stay with me that night. The unprofessional, rude and uncivilised executive in the reception was rudely shouting at us- that we did not inform about his stay. I said at the time of checkout we would and you can add the additional guest charges. Then his voice came down.I had traveled to Vizag for a business meeting in June and had stayed at the Five Elements hotel. It was a good choice overall. The rooms were clean and very well maintained. Breakfast was good, and was served in the room itself due to the Corona situation. Overall hygiene was really good. Location was fine and is well connected. Would recommend this place!Lovely Place, Hygienic and Clean Rooms,Co-operative Staff and Management, Perfect location, yummy food sums up my stay at Five Elements. Looking forward for one more excellent stay there. Buffet breakfast is too good and a special mention to filter coffee, absolutely loved it.Being a frequent traveller I visit many places and I wholeheartedly recommend five elements as the best place to stay in Vizag . Every time I stay here , the warmth and care I receive from the owner and the entire staff is incomparable.. Rooms are best kept and so tidy as if they are new, the breakfast spread is so delicious and irresistible.. Hospitality at its best.. I strongly recommend other hoteliers to come and learn the the real meaning of Hospitality from the owner Mr Srinivasgaru.. My home at vizag is Five Elements.It‚Äôs a reasonably priced hotel located in one of the main areas in Vizag. I stayed there for two days and didn‚Äôt face issues. The staff was very polite and approachable. The rooms were clean and the food was good too.",0.42,2

They say non Smoking but they allowed smoking people inside the rooms which bypassed easily to our rooms. They charged 2k per night to stay at their hotel. In online it showed only 800 rupees for non ac room. but we will not be able to book online. If we go directly and check in they charge 2000 for ac and 1500 for Non ac. In side the room we had only one towel one small soap and 1 rupee shampoo packet. Apart from that nothing in that room. Not even drinking water available. Tv and ac were in good working condition. We didn't get hot water for both of our rooms through our stay. Only good thing was rooms and bathroom were clean.I booked this hotel from mmt and location of the hotel given wrong it's out side of city and terrible room and cleaning is worse also bathroom ware not properly clean not a single toiletries mention provided.We stayed as a group for 2 nights and had to cater food for outside event. Srikanth MD of Homey Suites supported us a lot, was passionate about the quality of food and delivering a perfect customer service. Also his team at the Reception took fantastic care of us, introduced us to new Vizag food discoveries and were trying to fulfill all our special wishes. Truly customer service and Perfect ambience for small get-together, polite staff and delicious food . Thanks to the whole Homey Suites Team VizagWhy Homey Suites? 1. Comfortable room - for bachelors specifically. 2. Near to Beach Road 3. Nice view of Kailasgiri from terrace. --- I don't find any other reasons --- Why Not Homey Suites? 1. Had booked 2 rooms 1 & half month early on and had requested to reserve consecutive rooms (atleast in same floor if not consecutive), but when we went there they gave us 2 rooms in 2 different floors - which they changed and gave in same floor the next day (which delayed our scheduled plans as we were supposed pack stuffs and change the room). 2. One room was pretty small compared to other, when rooms were booked for 3+3 adults. 3. Water remains stagnant for longer period after bathing, when complained to manager he said he will look after that but we didn't see any difference‚Ä¶The property is homely and cozy. Very nearer- walkable to a couple of beaches. On the other hand, is equipped with average furnishings. Not rude, but unprofessional service.

Nice location on the seafront. Though the room and the bath could be a bit larger, the bed was large. View from the rooms were splendid. Basement car parking facility available for the boarders, if they arrive by car. Nice complementary breakfast. They also encourage you to visit their rooftop area, where you are welcome to sit and enjoy the breeze and the view of the sea. I shall recommend this hotel.We booked the hotel after going through the reviews as we wanted a beach side hotel from where we can enjoy the sea and the sunrise. As we planned so we acted. The rio beach hotel gives you a beautiful clear view of the RK beach . You can enjoy the sunrise from your bed sipping on your cup of morning coffee. What else do you need?? The guys in the reception were quite helpful in most of the times. They don‚Äôt have an in-house restaurant, but will provide you the cutlery and dish for free if you order your food from zomato. Few things that needed improvement- 1. No WiFi network from your room (we stayed in 314). 2. The room key never worked. So every time we moved into the hotel, we have to ask for the master key. 3. The parking is a headache. They have dedicated parking lot‚Ä¶The hotel is located opp the RK beach beach and the rooms are neat and clean. There are close by hotels available next to the hotel, in case you want to have breakfast or lunch. The hotel has no inhouse restaurant, hence no cimplimentary breakfast is provided. Water bottles are provided as complimentaryI stay last month it's a very great full moment and enjoy of peaks great full location Very good hotel friendly staff and local travel agent very best service and cleaness awesome.Very near To Ramakrishna Beach.The only great thing about the hotel is the Elite room as its beach facing on the RK beach. The hotel is just next to Matsya darshini. The room was big and clean, bed was clean. The bathroom was clean. Tv and AC were working fine. I stayed in their premier room as well and you can see the sea partially from the side window, this room was also clean and good. They offer room service as in, food will come from hotel Punjabi grill and i had ordered dinner once it was ok. Breakfast was served on terrace and it was also outsourced. breakfast was tasty but very few items. If you dont go early, few items like medu wadas, fruits and juices would get over, the tables would not be cleared and you will have to look out where to sit! They need to manage well and give good service. Staff was‚Ä¶The hotel is right on front of RK beach. The promenade is worth watching and the place is hustling and bustling from 6 am till 11 pm at night. Our room was on 4th floor and beach facing. The rooms were spacious and stay was overall comfortable. The property does not have a restaurant though, but a small pantry to serve breakfast. The view from the terrace at the top is worth. We were here for 2 nights and Overall, value for money.Good place to stay , morning breakfast was home made and excellent in taste, rooms were need and tidy. Got good deal from MMT. I like the view Close to beach., Near by marine and aquarium. Many restaurantsThe hotel seemed to be a fairly well maintained property, right next to the Matsya Darshini aquarium, on the RK beach road. Had booked the elite room, supposedly the best in the hotel. The room was aesthetically designed, well equipped with all the modern amenities for material comfort. Had a great view overlooking the beach road and the Rama Krishna beach beyond. However, that's pretty much all you could expect. Though complimentary breakfast was included, there was no buffet spread. Breakfast was delivered to the room and options were also limited, taste was acceptable. Could order lunch/dinner, but it was from the restaurant opposite to the hotel. Laundry service (essential for any beach destination) was only available in the evening with a 24hrs turnaround time. Basically,‚Ä¶Rio Beach hotel is one of the best hotels that I have visited so far. The sea facing view is simply amazing along with the lively view of the road overlooking the beach. The rooms are elegant, clean and cosy with all modern amenities and good service as well. The WI Fi connection needs to be worked on a little more though.Had to wait a bit for checkin. The rooms are extremely clean. The size if ok for 3, a bit small for 3. A downside is no restaurant. Location is great and a great view from the best room. Per room for me was 4600!!",0.48,2

I would like to mention 2 things. First, there was some water crisis on the first day of our stay. The staff was very generous to help us out since we needed to bathe and go to bathroom. The next night, water line was closed for some reason and we asked for their help since we needed to freshen up. They got us water from large containers and also opened the water line for 10 minutes. I just‚Ä¶Stayed here for a weekend. We are all arranged, good rooms, good attentive service. For two months of living in India, this is one of the few hotels where we could sleep well overnight. This is all thanks to the wonderful mattresses !!! and low noise from the street. The rooms have good air conditioning. There are minimal hygiene measures such as a toothbrush, soap, gel, shampoo. The hotel staff is friendly and easy to contact. There is no gym and swimming pool in the hotel, although on some sites such information is indicated. Hairdryer need to ask at the reception. If you are European and accustomed to using toilet paper, and not to the hygienic shower, then ask toilet paper from the staff and you will bring it. Usually not available in the rooms. Breakfast at the hotel is‚Ä¶great experience staff was polite and very quick service i got it from them and i prefer this hotel every time ,from station to hotel very less time to travel rooms are superb and i found it very cleanNice hospitality quick and good service.

Next morning we had to leave the hotel by 05:30hrs, so, we had to use stairs along with our luggage, there was no one to take our luggage down. That was very pathetic condition. There should an emergency service to handle such situation. So, my advice to elderly persons not to choose this hotel.Hotel was clean and tidy. Very supportive staff. They arranged for all the things even when we asked in last minute. Thank you Treebo hotels,Rainbow grand and team for making our trip memorable.

Ask for a room with sea view on higher floor. Breakfast buffet and meals are reasonably priced. Good food. Paradise restaurant is in the same hotel complex. Service is good, staff is polite.Wonderful ambience, amazing hospitality, delicious breakfast spread, sparkling clean rooms and ever-smiling staffs. Superb experience in a nutshell. Highly recommended for a refreshing stay hotel is value for the money spent. It definitely meets my expectation in terms of rooms, facilities, restaurant and food quality.Had a good breakfast I would like to give 5 star rating for service Sandeep is very helpful and easy to communicate Sourya is good at welcoming nature Service is good along with the view Loved the itemsA hotel close to RK Beach. Most of their rooms are beach facing. The hotel staff is courteous and helpful. I liked their housekeeping staff, they were very quick to address my requests. Only drawback, their restaurant has limited menu. They also provide complimentary breakfast when you stay with them.:) . Most tourist locations are easily accessible from the hotel. But the biggest plus was RK beach, the moment you are out of the hotel you will be at the beach :).. A good option, if one wants to stay close to the beach.I stayed here for 5 nights. The location of the property is fantastic and just opposite to RK Beach. Executive rooms are direct sea facing and the deluxe rooms are not sea facing. Rooms are not properly maintained and so as the bathroom. Size of executive room is good. Service is pathetic. If anything is asked for then minimum TAT is 10 minutes and that too after repeated reminders. Staffs were not well trained and lacks professionalism. Front office staffs were helpful. Quality of buffet breakfast was good but it lacks varieties. During my course of stay, same menu was repeated everyday. Taste of ala carte menu was not good. The hotel does not provide laundry service. However, hotel will make arrangements to get it clean from outside but the clothes would be returned on next‚Ä¶",0.4,2

We kept on waiting after giving our details, were waiting in front of the reception. In between I even asked them also why it taking time, they told they will send soon. Coolly around 3 20 they came and told they have closed the restaurant and won't serve and we have to leave. Had they told earlier that they wont serve after 3pm even if we wait, we would not waited and wasted our time there. They spoilt our mood and quality outing with family after hectic schedules. it was too late to go elsewhere for lunch also. Worst management ever seen in any place till now.
